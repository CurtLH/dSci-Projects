       " 'bio': \"The son of a former NBA player, Manning was a two-sport star who could have gone on to play both sports at Loyola-Marymount, and when the Tigers went slightly above pick value to sign him away from that commitment, they knew Manning might be a bit of a project. The Tigers have proceeded with understandable caution, holding the 6-foot-6 right-hander back in extended Spring Training to start his first full year of pro ball. He eventually pitched his way from short-season Connecticut to full-season West Michigan, capping his season off with a 10-strikeout performance in the Midwest League playoffs.Manning has as much, if not more, upside than any pitcher in the Tigers system, but he also might have the farthest to go to reach it. As he works to refine his delivery, his command and velocity has fluctuated. When he's in sync, he's easily in the low-90s with the ability to touch 95-96 mph with ease. It's easy to dream on more consistent velocity as he figures things out. His power curve has the chance to be a plus pitch in the future, and while his changeup lags behind, he's shown some feel for it and it should give him a third at-least-average offering at his disposal.Manning's command fluctuated largely because of mechanical flaws, which his athleticism should help him iron out as he progresses. It's going to take time, but the end product could very well be a frontline starter.\",\n",
